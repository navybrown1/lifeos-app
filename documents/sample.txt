# Project Alpha: Requirements Specification

**Author:** Dr. Jane Smith  
**Date:** 02/10/2026  
**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

Project Alpha is a document intelligence platform designed to help teams extract insights from unstructured documents. The system must support DOCX, PDF, and plain text formats. All content shall be derived at runtime with no hard-coded document content.

## Scope and Objectives

The primary objective is to build an explorable document interface. Users should be able to navigate sections, search entities, and export requirements. The platform may support additional formats in future releases.

### definition

A requirement is defined as any statement containing must, should, or may. The system shall parse these and convert them into a checklist format.

### Key Deliverables

1. Overview tab with executive summary
2. Outline navigator with search
3. Entities and relationship graph
4. Requirements checklist with export
5. Visual insights and charts
6. Q&A workbench grounded in document text

## Technical Requirements

### Must-Have Features

The application must support document upload via file picker. The application must parse DOCX using mammoth and PDF using pdf-parse. Error handling is required for missing files and parse failures.

All entities must be extracted using regex patterns and heuristic rules. People, organizations, dates, and metrics should be detected. The system shall provide first and last occurrence for each entity.

### Should-Have Features

The requirements tab should allow filtering by type (must, should, may). Export to CSV and JSON should be available. The command palette (Ctrl/Cmd+K) should support quick navigation.

### Constraints

- Maximum file size: 10MB
- Supported formats: DOCX, PDF, TXT
- No external API dependencies for parsing

## Timeline and Milestones

- Phase 1: Core parsing - Due 03/01/2026
- Phase 2: UI implementation - Due 03/15/2026
- Phase 3: Testing and deployment - Due 03/30/2026

## Risk Factors

Sections containing words like "not", "unlikely", "error", or "fail" may indicate ambiguity. The risk score is computed heuristically. Documentation that cannot be parsed should fail gracefully.
